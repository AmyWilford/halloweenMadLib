    <p>Tonight is the night when all of the ADJECTIVE Monsters come out to VERB.</p>
    <p>My name is NAME and this year I'm dressing up as a COSTUME to go trick or treating. FAMILY MEMBER is going with me - they are dressed up as a COSTUME2.</p>
    <p>I hope we see a CREATURE tonight so I can say HAPPY HALLOWEEN!</p>
